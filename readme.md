# Analysis of SEC reports using word embedding

## Background

This was the final project for a course in deep learning. We used Python for web scraping, analysis, and data visualization, and PyTorch to build and train neural networks. Check out the writeup for details.

## Abstract

A Word2Vec model was trained from scratch from a
dataset of SEC filings, with the aim of performing topic
modeling to predict future price movements of public stocks.
While the Word2Vec vectors were not used in the final
project, they acquired significant semantic information and
we discuss possible improvements that could have made this
approach viable.
